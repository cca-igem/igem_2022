              <h2 data-scroll>Choosing our Compound</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                An important principle in securing the environmental viability
                of SchistoGONE was selecting the anti-schistosomal compound with
                the best balance in environmental safety and anti-schistosomal
                efficiency. To do this, we repeated a process of research and
                redesign of the project which can be highlighted by our journey
                through candidate compounds plumbagin, ent-pimaradienoic acid,
                curcumin, arachidonic acid, and ent-kaurenoic acid.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our first choice was plumbagin, a plant-based organic compound
                with proven antischistosomal effects in vitro against the
                cercarial phase (Zhang et al., 12). Following further research,
                however, we consulted numerous professors who—using their
                experience in parasitic diseases and schistosomes—helped us
                determine the extreme environmental hazards involved in using
                plumbagin. Plumbagin has detrimental effects on other wildlife
                including fish, crustaceans, and snails with concentrations of
                just 0.9mg/L leading to fatality in fish (Tu et al., 20).F
                <br />
                <br />
                Our second choice of ent-pimaradienoic acid had the opposite
                problem in the balance between anti-schistosomal efficiency and
                environmental viability. Ent-pimaradienoic acid was tested
                in-vivo in mice with proof of antischistosomal properties and no
                signs of toxicity (Mao et al., 20). However, the isomer of
                pimaradienoic acid that we had the capacity to produce via
                synthetic biology was syn-pimaradienoic acid, a distinct
                constitutional isomer that would predictably have different
                chemical properties and yield different results.
                Syn-pimaradienoic acid is produced through a different branch of
                pimarane diterpenoid biosynthetic pathways, and the biosynthetic
                pathway of ent-pimaradienoic acid is not yet elucidated, meaning
                we are unable to reliably produce the anti-schistosomal isomer.
                Moreover, the pimaradienoic acid stereoisomer available to
                industry for purchase is the enantiomer of ent-pimaradienoic
                acid, called continentalic acid, which presumably has yet
                another set of chemical properties. Indeed, in vitro tests of
                continentalic acid on schistosoma sporocysts through our
                partnership with UCSD’s Center for Discovery and Innovation in
                Parasitic Disease (CDIPD) confirmed this as zero effects were
                recorded at all concentrations. The discrepancies between the
                isomers we could purchase, produce, and the one used in the
                original paper made it impossible to rely on pimaradienoic acid.
                <br />
                <br />
                Curcurin was evaluated and found to have antischistosomal
                properties as it caused the death of all adult schistosoma
                mansoni adult worms in doses ranging from 5-100 mM (Magalhães et
                al., 09). However, the issue present was that the biosynthesis
                pathway to produce curcumin was unclear and had many critical
                parts missing, meaning that it would be extremely difficult to
                produce the compound itself. It had little to no precedent, and
                the gene sequences of the enzymes responsible for catalyzing its
                production are not yet elucidated.
                <br />
                <br />
                Arachidonic acid had a similar problem in the replication of the
                biosynthesis pathway. Though it had been found to be safe and
                efficacious in killing schistosoma mansoni worms in mice and
                hamsters, arachidonic acid’s pathway was only half known
                (Tallima et al 20). Through extensive research it was determined
                that only the second half of the biosynthesis pathway for
                arachidonic acid was present in literature while the first half
                was unknown, making this compound unreliable for testing in the
                SchistoGONE project.
                <br />
                <br />
                Ent-kaurenoic acid was a candidate compound due to its initial
                viability as a schistosomide and the clarity of its biosynthesis
                pathways. After further research it was found that in actuality,
                ent-kaurenoic acid was not effective against all stages of the
                worm’s life cycle and only derivatives of the compound are
                considered promising (Oliveira et al 20). This meant that it
                would be inefficacious for SchistoGONE’s goal, which involves
                killing the worm at its sporocyst stage.
                <br />
                <br />
                Sanguinarine was selected as the natural product to use in this
                project. It was found that sanguinarine resulted in 100%
                schistosome mortality in concentrations of 10 μM (equivalent to
                3.68 μg/mL), meeting the World Health Organization's criteria of
                "hit" compounds for controlling schistosomiasis (Zhang et al
                12). The results of the compound testing on specifically
                schistosoma sporocysts conducted under the UCSD CDIPD revealed
                that sanguinarine had the highest effectiveness against in-vitro
                sporocysts compared to plumbagin and the enantiomer of
                pimaradienoic acid, continentalic acid. After just 0.05 μM
                concentration of sanguinarine, sporocysts began to die. And by 1
                μM concentration of sanguinarine, 100% sporocyst mortality was
                recorded.
                <br />
                <br />
                In terms of environmental safety, sanguinarine has been tested
                for toxicity via in vitro assays and in-vivo lab rat trials
                revealing insignificant effects on organisms (Mackraj et al.,
                2008). Furthermore, the unrestrained environmental release of
                the compound is improbable. The biosynthesis pathway involves
                multiple modified yeast and e.coli organisms that produce benign
                substrates of sanguinarine (Fossati et al, 2014). Should the
                modified organisms be swept into the river or dispersed in the
                environment, the construction of sanguinarine by a single yeast
                cell would not be possible. Sanguinarine’s efficacy as a
                schistosomide and its environmental safety led this compound to
                be chosen for the SchistoGONE project.

              <h2 data-scroll>Verifying the Compounds</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                A primary desire of ours at the beginning of the compound
                selection process was verifying anti-schistosomal properties,
                which would entail testing on real Schistosoma sporocysts. Such
                data was necessary as many of the compounds had never been
                tested specifically on sporocysts before; and some, such as the
                differing isomers of pimaradienoic acid, had little basis in the
                literature as an anti-schistosomal in general. This would have
                been extremely difficult for our team to do, however, as
                schistosomiasis is a deadly parasitic disease. Our high school
                team lacked the credibility, funds, and safety measures to
                successfully purchase schistosomes for our own research use.
                Furthermore, the labspace we were working at specifically barred
                handling the parasites. The liability and legality of holding
                live schistosomes would thus be impossible for our team of
                minors.
                <br />
                <br />
                Fortunately, through our contact with Dr. Conor R. Caffrey from
                the CDIPD, a lab that specializes in tropical parasitic diseases
                and already operates with live schistosoma parasites, the CDIPD
                agreed to conduct the compound testing experiments in our place.
                <br />
                <br />
                Schistosoma miracidia are suspended in a medium and then tricked
                via addition of salts and other stimuli to simulate presence
                inside of a snail. The conditions trigger the miracidia’s
                internal mechanisms to transform into sporocysts—a stage which
                they will preserve for around 7 days. During that time, an assay
                of pimaradienoic acid, sanguinarine, and plumbagin is conducted
                on the sporocysts. Data is collected on the concentrations of
                each compound and the efficacy of schistosome killing given by a
                proportion out of 100 of the sporocysts killed. The data
                recorded allows for an analysis on which compound is capable of
                killing the highest amount of schistosomes after 24 hours in the
                least amount of concentration possible.

                <h2 data-scroll>Optimizing the Biosynthesis Pathway</h2>
                <p data-scroll>
                  Sanguinarine is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid (BIA) whose complex biosynthetic pathway is closely related to those of well-documented morphinans. The production of BIAs using yeast expression systems has precedent in the literature, with the sanguinarine pathway having been successfully reconstituted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using (R,S)-THP as a fed substrate (Trenchard and Smolke, 2015). However, we endeavored to connect the THP production pathway directly to the sanguinarine production pathway. This would require combining a Escherichia coli expression system with a S. cerevisiae expression system in a concerted multi-strain expression mechanism.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In fundamental terms, most BIAs are derived from L-tyrosine, an amino acid precursor of L-DOPA and dopamine that is naturally available in E. coli. A tyrosinase—in this case RsTYR, isolated from the wilt bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum—catalyzes the formation of L-DOPA from L-tyrosine, a precursor of dopamine that is converted to such by DOPA decarboxylase (DDC, or DODC). A monoamine oxidase (MAO) then converts dopamine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (3,4-DHPAA), a dopaldehyde that spontaneously condenses to form an enantiomeric mixture of (R)- and (S)-tetrahydropapaveroline (-THP) via a Pictet-Spengler reaction. We roughly followed a documented reconstitution of this portion of the biosynthesis in a two-strain E. coli expression system (Nakagawa et al., 2014) while optimizing enzymes chosen.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This first biosynthetic phase is difficult to reconstitute in heterologous expression systems due to the fact that TYR demonstrated o-diphenolase activity toward both L-tyrosine, its intended substrate, and THP, the intended product and the major BIA precursor (Nakagawa et al., 2014)—tyrosinases are known naturally to have both monophenolase and o-diphenolase activity under aerobic conditions. A portion of produced THP would thus be oxidized, which would produce lower yields than desired. We then optimized our choice of TYR by choosing one that possessed a comparatively lower o-diphenolase activity: a RsTYR (Romero et al., 2006). The two-step conversion from L-DOPA to 3,4-DHPAA, catalyzed by DDC and MAO, was bypassed by replacing those enzymes with a DHPAA synthase (DHPAAS) from the mosquito Aedes aegypti (Vavricka et al., 2011). DHPAAS has been identified in multiple species of insect, including A. aegypti, Drosophila melanogaster, and Anopheles gambiae, to directly produce 3,4-DHPAA from L-DOPA in a one-step conversion (Vavricka et al., 2011). The replacement of DDC and MAO with DHPAAS also reduced the number of genes to be introduced into E. coli.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The next portion of sanguinarine’s biosynthetic pathway involves the 11-step conversion of (R,S)-THP to sanguinarine through a series of alkaloid intermediates. The enzymes responsible for catalyzing each of these conversions are, respectively, norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase (6OMT); coclaurine N-methyltransferase (CNMT); 4’-O-methyltransferase (4’OMT); berberine bridge enzyme (BBE); cheilanthifoline synthase (CFS), a cytochrome P450 (CYP); a cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR); stylopine synthase (STS); tetrahydroprotoberberine N-methyltransferase (TNMT); cis-N-methylstylopine 14-hydroxylase (MSH); protopine 6-hydroxylase (P6H); and dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase (DBOX), which was experimentally observed to be unnecessary in heterologous sanguinarine production (Trenchard and Smolke, 2015). For our design, gene variants (i.e., originating from the opium poppy Papaver somniferum, enzyme abbreviation prefix Ps, or California poppy Eschscholzia californica, prefix Ec) were selected based on optimization data from Trenchard and Smolke (2015). ATR1 is a CYP from Arabidopsis thaliana.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This pathway has previously been reconstituted using a two-strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system, with first producing the intermediate (S)-reticuline using 6OMT, CNMT, and 4’OMT and the second continuing the pathway to produce sanguinarine using the remaining enzymes (Hawkins and Smolke, 2008; Trenchard and Smolke, 2015). A 6OMT-CNMT expression plasmid and 4’OMT expression plasmid were used in the first strain (Hawkins and Smolke, 2008), and Gateway-compatible single expression plasmids containing individual recombinant genes were used in the second strain (Trenchard and Smolke, 2015), with expression cassettes being homologously integrated into the S. cerevisiae genome in each case. Stylopine has also been produced in Pichia pastoris from the fed substrate reticuline using recombinant BBE, CFS, and STS genes (Hori et al., 2016). 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The P. pastoris-based stylopine production system cloned all three genes involved into a single vector, but for greater simplicity and due to the entire THP-to-sanguinarine pathway involving ten enzymes, we opted to express pairs of the genes in the THP-to-sanguinarine portion of the pathway (with five yeast plasmids expressing 6OMT-CNMT, 4’OMT-BBE, ATR1-CFS, STS-TNMT, and MSH-P6H).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The THP production pathway plasmids were designed for transformation into standard E. coli strain K-12 due to precedent existing for bacterial expression (Nakagawa et al., 2014). The incompatibility of cytochromes P450 and their reductases with prokaryotic expression systems due to their being membrane-associated proteins led us to select S. cerevisiae strain W303α (genotype MATα: leu2-3,112 trp1-1 can1-100 ura3-1 ade2-1 his3-11,15), which has exhibited good yield of recombinant BIAs in the literature (Hawkins and Smolke, 2010; Trenchard and Smolke, 2015).

                  RsTYR (enzyme reference number EC 1.14.18.1; GenBank accession number NP_518458) and DHPAAS (EC 4.1.1.107) were codon-optimized for expression in E. coli. The coding sequence of each enzyme was cloned into separate pET-28a(+) bacterial vectors with a T7-lac promoter expression system, creating Plasmids A (TYR) and B (DHPAAS). pET-28a(+) is well-documented as a leading choice for recombinant protein expression in E. coli and contains an N-terminal His-tag (Shilling et al., 2020). Each gene fragment was designed to be cloned into the multiple cloning site of the PCR-linearized vector via Gibson assembly.

                  While the method of Trenchard and Smolke (2015) relies on S. cerevisiae-based plasmids expressing individual genes and uses Gateway cloning procedures, the method of Hori et. al (2014) expresses three genes in one plasmid and still produced desirable titers of stylopine, albeit in P. pastoris. The latter reports P. pastoris as being more effective than S. cerevisiae for multi-gene expression, but this was a comparison based only on the BBE-CFS-STS steps of the biosynthetic pathway with no data on the other steps (Hori et al., 2016). Only Saccharomyces was available to us for experimentation, and following a series of professor consultations we decided to continue with S. cerevisiae while expressing two genes per plasmid, a novel modified combination of the aforementioned methods. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In theory, the integration of each plasmid into the yeast genome via homologous recombination would produce the most optimal and stable yields as compared to the presence of multiple episomal plasmids. In this circumstance, each gene is to be placed into a cassette cloned into a yeast expression vector (YEp), allowing for the measurement of enzyme production and, in the presence of their respective substrates, compound production. After ascertaining the success of this initial cloning process, gene cassettes would be linearized and subcloned into yeast integrative vectors (YIp), which lack origins of replication and will become integrated into the chromosome at specific loci with appropriately-designed homology regions. Nevertheless, we first introduced the YEps episomally into yeast cells to test their fundamental functionality. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We considered multiple methods for the simultaneous expression of two genes in one plasmid for the reconstitution of the THP-to-sanguinarine pathway. Polycistronic (IRES) vectors, in which one promoter controls the expression of multiple genes with internal ribosome entry sites, are not particularly well-characterized in yeast, especially in the context of phytochemical expression. Most studies relating to phytochemistry and biosynthesis use plasmids containing either divergent dual promoters or sequential gene cassettes controlled by different promoters. The use of the same promoter multiple times in one plasmid, however, may be met with complications relating to interference and unwanted spontaneous homologous recombination. A two-cassette expression system was therefore designed, whereby each plasmid consisted of a PCR-linearized pXP418 vector backbone and two gene cassettes: the first gene would be controlled by the TEF1 promoter already present in the vector, followed by an ADH1 terminator fragment; the second would be controlled by a variable promoter fragment optimized for the second gene and the CYC1 terminator in the vector. pXP418 is a high-copy plasmid vector chosen for the presence of a 2-micron origin of replication (2μ ori); URA3 auxotrophic marker; and TEF1 promoter, a strong constitutive promoter commonly used for controlling the expression of plant-derived enzymes previously used in this context (Hawkins and Smolke, 2010). The gene fragments, ADH1 terminator sequence, and variable promoter sequence were then to be assembled via Gibson assembly into the linearized vector.

                  <br />
                  The yeast plasmids were organized and numbered as follows: Plasmid 1, expressing 6OMT and CNMT; Plasmid 2, 4’OMT and BBE; Plasmid 3, ATR1 and CFS; Plasmid 4, STS and TNMT; and Plasmid 5, MSH and P6H.

                What if yeast gets into the water?
              </h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                One of the primary concerns regarding the practicality of the
                implementation of SchistoGONE is the potential impact to water
                quality and the environment in a situation where our yeast is
                erroneously released. The high prevalence of schistosomiasis in
                water-scarce regions and in populations dependent on natural
                bodies of water for most, if not all, of their water supply
                exacerbates the potential concerns that released yeast may have
                in water. For instance, South Africa, a country affected by
                schistosomiasis, is currently facing a water shortage crisis and
                as a result, authorities could be hesitant to put remaining
                water sources under potential risk of harm, which may include
                yeast. Furthermore, as detailed comprehensively in our
                environmental analysis, rich biodiversity is centered in water
                habitats within schistosomiasis-afflicted regions, and an
                uncontrolled release of yeast could result in ecosystem
                disruption.
                <br />
                <br />
                The nature of our project, however, addresses these concerns.
                SchistoGONE intends on utilizing genetically modified
                S.Cerevisiae yeast to synthesize antiparasitic products within
                isolated plates docked on the shore. The plates will contain a
                bioreactor and the necessary medium in order to carry out this
                function. In a situation where yeast is released into the water,
                it will be relatively benign. This is because without nutrients
                provided by the medium held in the plates and S.Cerevisiae's
                inability to compete for resources with other microorganisms, it
                will quickly use up its surplus resources, enhanced by the usage
                of energy in producing naturally inessential antiparasitic
                products, and die out. The excess production and release of
                antiparasitic products will not be of much concern either, as
                the yeast requires a substrate to bind in order to synthesize
                these products which are not available outside of the plates.
                <br /><br />

              <p data-scroll>
                In most cases, the yeast will not be harmful to snails. When
                released from the bioreactor, we have ensured that the yeast
                stays relatively benign, as it doesn't have the proper nutrients
                to sustain its lifestyle. While it might survive for a short
                period of time, other microorganisms will outcompete it, leading
                to no long-term impact on snails.

                The Nigerian federal government is split into many distinct
                civil service departments, collectively known as the Federal
                Ministries of Nigeria. There are two ministries that are
                relevant to our schistosomiasis project: the Federal Ministry of
                Water Resources and the Federal Ministry of Public Health.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Federal Ministry of Water Resources is responsible for
                developing and implementing policies to provide all Nigerians
                with safe access to water. One such policy is the National Water
                Resources Policy, which outlines the regulatory framework to
                achieve the goals of the state. As stated under the policy,
                water is a basic human right and an asset of the state, so
                private ownership of water is not allowed. Since our plan
                targets publicly owned waterways, we would need to seek approval
                from the ministry to implement our project. The ministry is
                heavily underfunded, so cooperation with private partners and
                donations are vital to the success of the program. In the past,
                there have also been issues in maintaining proper surveying and
                monitoring post-implementation, so additional personnel and
                resources would need to be provided.
                <br /><br />
                Specifically, in accordance with the Policy Statement 8 (Water
                Supply and Sanitation), the ministry is responsible for
                providing sufficient and adequate sanitation to enhance health.
                This includes initiatives to promote technology within the
                sanitation sector and prevent water-borne illnesses. Since our
                project attempts to use technology to clean water and remove
                parasitic worms that can spread schistosomiasis to humans, some
                of those initiatives would be likely to help us.

                What local laws would be harmful for us in implementing our

              </h2>

                Established in 1997 under the Federal Ministry of Transport, the
                National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) was named the primary
                authority for the regulation and development of inland navigable
                waterways in Nigeria. NIWA is the main governmental authority
                able to regulate waterways throughout the nation, with
                responsibilities spanning from infrastructure development to
                navigation to environmental surveying. Even with state
                governments attempting to gain control over their own waterways,
                such as the Lagos State Waterways Authority, NIWA was still
                legally declared by the Federal High Court as the competent
                authority. Well, that was up until 2017.
                <br />
                <br />
                After an appeal by the Lagos State authorities in July of 2017,
                the dispute over control of Nigerian waterways became much more
                convoluted. Both the state government and NIWA claim to have won
                the authority to control the navigable waterways in Lagos, with
                representatives on both sides publicly announcing to the media
                their opinion. It is generally accepted that all interstate
                waterways, those that run between two or more states, are under
                federal jurisdiction. This includes most of the largest bodies
                of water in Nigeria&mdash;such as the River Niger, the River
                Benue, and Lake Chad&mdash;which supply water to the majority of
                Nigerians. All intrastate and inland waterways, those that start
                and end entirely within one state, not mentioned under the NIWA
                are under state jurisdiction, though there is little clarity
                over the definition of "other intrastate waterways." The hazy
                line between state and federal authority in Nigeria complicates
                the process of seeking approval for projects involving waterways
                across the nation.
                <br /><br />
                In order for our project to be legally approved and granted a
                permit to implement SchistoGONE, we would likely need to go
                through the NIWA Research, Planning, and Environment (RPE)
                Department, which is responsible for Health, Safety, and
                Environment. While schistosomiasis is not explicitly listed
                among their responsibilities, the RPE handles all policy issues,
                budget preparations, and project monitoring about the
                surrounding environment of waterways. To attain public approval,
                we would need to conduct an extensive impact assessment to
                identify the main environmental implications of our project and
                how we can best create a low-risk, low-reliability plan. The
                funding for the project would have to come entirely from Public
                Private partnerships (PPP), as previous efforts by the Nigerian
                federal government to curb schistosomiasis were unsuccessful and
                these programs are generally underfunded.

                have to take?
              </h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                Before implementation, we would have to confirm that the
                country's laws align with our project and that we have all
                necessary approval. Unfortunately, in many parts of Africa,
                where schistosomiasis is most common, there are no laws that
                address the use of synthetic biology. Because it could
                potentially be harmful to the environment and its people, most
                developing countries are reluctant about risky new technology.
                However, synthetic biology and biosafety conferences are being
                held and we are optimistic that countries will take this step in
                implementing synthetic biology.
                <br />
                <br />
                Because there are only synthetic biology laws in Nigeria, South
                Africa, and Kenya, we will be mainly focusing on laws in these
                countries, in hopes that other African countries will have
                similar synbio laws in the future.
                <br /><br />
                In Nigeria, we would have to get our project approved by the
                National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA), established in 2015
                by the Nigeria Biosafety Bill. Their core belief is that
                synthetic biology may help solve poverty issues, and have
                already implemented agricultural biotechnology to improve food
                security. The new regulations state that any project involving
                gene drive, gene editing, and synthetic biology must gain
                approval from the Agency to best minimize adverse effects. After
                submitting an application to the Agency, an internal review must
                be conducted with the possibility of additional information
                requests. Within 21 days, the project can be approved,
                indicating a relatively quick time frame from application to
                implementation. Since our final product contains recombinant
                DNA, it must also undergo a GMO regulation process.

                How long would the potential approval process take?
              </h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                As discussed throughout our review of schistosomiasis policy,
                many countries in which schistosomiasis is prevalent have
                agencies responsible for public health and water management with
                specific regulations and rules regarding project approval.
                However, durations for this vary due to numerous political and
                social considerations that we could potentially encounter in
                countries of interest.
                <br />
                <br />
                One of the primary hindrances to the approval of SchistoGONE in
                many countries studied is the lack of state funding and
                investment into schistosomiasis related causes, or an
                unwillingness to financially support initiatives with potential
                economic and environmental consequences if unsuccessful. For
                instance, Nigeria has been condemned by public health academics
                both within and internationally due to their relative inaction,
                exacerbated by the emergence of COVID-19. Despite commitments to
                the London Declaration and many WHO initiatives throughout the
                last 20 years, Nigeria has observed little to no changes in
                their schistosomiasis mortality rate. As discussed by Professor
                Oyeyemi at the University of Medical Science in Ondo State, the
                Nigerian government is only willing to invest in low-risk,
                low-liability plans with minimal economic commitment, which
                contrasts with the nature of our project. As a result, a
                meticulous process involving a solidified proof of concept and
                environmental analysis would be required in order to meet this
                criteria, which would require many years to conduct. However,
                other schistosomiasis-afflicted countries have demonstrated
                promising actions in order to tackle the disease. For instance,
                Kenya has implemented a deworming initiative which provide
                children with free deworming treatments. However, like Nigeria,
                Kenya and many other nations face other limiting factors.
