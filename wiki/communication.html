              <p data-scroll>
                Over the summer, our team hosted a STEM summer camp that encompassed biology,
                chemistry, synthetic biology, and forensics. We held two one-week sessions, and a
                total of 25 students attended. We wanted to hold our camp at the lab classrooms of
                our school so that students would have a more hands-on experience and learn more.
                Most of our students were in middle school, or between the ages of 11-14.

              <h2 data-scroll>Curriculum</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                We designed all of our curriculum for our camp, based around four subjects: Biology,
                Chemistry, Synthetic Biology, and Forensics. Since our main demographic was middle
                schoolers interested in science, we aimed for a 9th-10th grade level of difficulty,
                especially in biology and chemistry. We wanted to cover biology and chemistry in the
                first two days because it would be essential for understanding synthetic biology and
                forensics, two subjects that aren't taught in school.
                <br /><br />
                Every day, we had several slide decks covering crucial topics for each subject. For
                instance, in chemistry, we'd have a separate lecture for the periodic table, matter,
                chemical reactions, and density. We also incorporated a few labs in between each
                lecture to reinforce the topics. Our slides were engaging and fun, with videos and
                simulations so that the students wouldn't get bored. We also had a participation
                point system with quiz questions for each slide deck, and the student with the most
                points received a gift card at the end of the week.

              <h2 data-scroll>Labs</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                We organized two to three labs each day. They reinforced what students learned
                during the lectures so that they could understand and visualize it better. We had a
                few simple labs such as strawberry DNA extraction and leaf chad photosynthesis, but
                we had quite a few complex labs as well. For example, for the synthetic biology
                portion, the students performed a bacterial transformation, putting GFP genes into
                e. Coli. Another advanced lab that we did measured how different factors, such as
                surface area, concentration, and temperatures, can affect the rate of chemical
                reactions.
                <br /><br />
                We made sure students were adequately prepared for each lab. We did a presentation
                about lab safety and etiquette, and proper consequences were reinforced for those
                who did not follow the safety procedures. Most of our students were pretty mature,
                so it wasn't a problem throughout both sessions.

              <h2 data-scroll>Survey Analysis</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                We had the students take a survey both before and after the camp in order to gauge
                how much they learned and benefitted from our camp. We had quiz questions about each
                of the topics taught, and the students tested their knowledge on the topics on the
                first and last day. Additionally, at the end, the students evaluated factors such as
                how much they paid attention and how much they thought they learned. <br /><br />
                Overall, students generally answered 7.5/10 on how much they felt they learned, and
                a 7.36/10 on how much they paid attention. The high scores for engagement reflect
                the increase in average quiz score. The "after" quiz score was 1.23 points higher
                than the "before" quiz score, with the total being out of 9.

                We created a 41-page book, <em>Introduction to Bacteria</em>, in order to provide a
                resource for understanding a critical domain of organisms. This included coverage on
                bacteria anatomy, classification, identification, functions, and applicability in
                synthetic biology and scientific study: our book's content is aligned with the Next
                Generation Science Standards (NGSS), ensuring its modernity and applicability in an
                educational environment. The book was created with the objective of providing a
                collective of relevant, well-rounded information for advanced middle school to
                college students to utilize. We intend on publishing our book through Amazon KDP,
                offering our book free of charge in order to achieve our objectives for the book's
                outreach to everyone.

                In order to extend our book's reach to a larger audience, we created translations of
                our book in Chinese, French, Korean, and Spanish. This enhances the accessibility of
                our book, especially to countries where access to STEM education may be limited by
                linguistic barriers. In an effort to ensure accessibility is considered in as many
                areas as possible, we also recorded an audio version of our book for auditory
                learners and individuals with certain impediments.

              <p data-scroll>
                Since schistosomiasis is a disease most commonly found in third world countries, not
                much research is done on the subject, and information on symptoms and treatments is
                inaccessible to many. Because of this, we created a website with easily accessible
                information about schistosomiasis. It contains a brief overview of the disease
                itself, including the disease's origin, how it is contracted, and current diagnosis
                methods and treatments. The website also details how the disease is spread, the most
                common symptoms, and the long-lasting impact of the illness on the human body.
                Through this website, we hope to raise awareness on schistosomiasis and educate a
                wider audience on its symptoms and treatments.
