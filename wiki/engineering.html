                Research and Design: In the process of designing our own
                microcosm of Lake Malawi, we followed inspiration from the
                methods and conditions of a research study that mimicked rice
                paddy fields in Africa (Akpodiete et al 21). The data on pH,
                sedimentation, salinity, temperature, general hardness, and
                carbonate hardness of Lake Malawi were recorded from the ILEC
                world lake database (Massangi et al 22).
                <br />
                <br />
                Build: We simulated the water conditions of a pH of 8.0,
                sedimentation, MgSO</sub>4</sub>⋅7H</sub>2</sub>O for general hardness of 7 degrees,
                K</sub>2</sub>CO</sub>3</sub> for a carbonate hardness of and maintained a temperature
                of around 25°C. Water from the microcosm was sourced and plated
                in CM Broth with Galactose minus URA plates before, immediately
                after, 3 hours after, and 24 hours after insertion of W303
                yeast.
                <br />
                <br />
                Test: There was zero growth observed on all four plates. INSERT
                IMAGE
                <br />
                <br />
                Learn: We rationalized that the lack of growth was due to the
                use of yeast plates without URA. Uracil is an auxotrophic marker
                that the mutant yeast strains have knocked out, meaning they
                need it in the plate in order to survive. Furthermore, the
                method of repeating 50mg steps of MgSO</sub>4</sub>⋅7H</sub>2</sub>O and K</sub>2</sub>CO</sub>3</sub> and then
                verifying the carbonate and general hardnesses using a
                commercial API GH and KH test kit leaves variability in GH and
                KH degrees.

              <h2 data-scroll>Introduction</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                Implementation of SchistoGONE will require several steps,
                including thorough consideration of the laws in the country we
                will apply it to. Unfortunately, in Africa, where
                schistosomiasis is most prevalent, there aren't any laws
                regarding synthetic biology safety. The field is still becoming
                accepted globally and many countries are not prepared to take on
                financial risks. However, Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya do
                have laws in place, so we will be studying their laws in hopes
                that other countries will soon follow suit.
                <br />
                <br />
                Firstly, there are policies and laws that would assist the
                implementation of SchistoGONE like the National Water Resources
                Policy, which outlines the regulatory framework to achieve the
                goals of the state and Policy Statement 8 (Water Supply and
                Sanitation). It includes initiatives to promote technology
                within the sanitation sector and prevent water-borne illnesses.
                However, complex disputes regarding waterways in
                Nigeria&mdash;one of our target countries&mdash;in 2017 between
                National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) and the state
                government may produce possible obstacles in implementing
                SchistoGONE in Nigeria. We would need to `go through the NIWA
                Research, Planning, and Environment (RPE) Department, which is
                responsible for Health, Safety, and Environment, and also
                conduct an extensive impact assessment to identify the main
                environmental implications of our project and how we can best
                create a low-risk, low-reliability plan for public approval.
                <br /><br />
                Most extensive information about synthetic biology laws in
                Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya is in our policy review.

              <p data-scroll>
                In order to prevent schistosomiasis, we will be genetically
                engineering W303 Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. The yeast will
                be placed on the shores of schistosomiasis-infected waters,
                attracting snails so that they will consume the yeast. Our
                modified W303 Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast will produce
                sanguinarine inside its cell walls, which will be released after
                snails consume the yeast and enzymes inside the snail's stomach
                have broken through the cell membranes and walls. The
                sanguinarine will kill the worms inside the snails, removing the
                disease once it enters the snail's bloodstream.

              <p data-scroll>
                We built a bioreactor to culture our yeast cells, and it will
                pump the yeast to plates on the shores of infected rivers.
                Snails will be attracted to the scent of the yeast and come up
                to the plates themselves. This way, we do not have to pour our
                compound into the rivers and risk disrupting other ecosystems
                and forms of life.

                Since our project would greatly impact the communities
                SchistoGONE is implemented into, communicating with the people
                whose water source will be affected would be a top priority. The
                public will be informed thoroughly about all aspects of the
                project, including the scientific reasoning behind the
                components of SchistoGONE and any possible side effects of using
                or consuming the affected water. Education on this subject would
                hopefully create a relationship of trust between our team and
                the community, allowing for a constant stream of feedback and
                responses. Before implementation, we want to answer any
                questions citizens have and resolve any of their concerns so
                that SchistoGONE can benefit as many people as possible without
                becoming a source of grievance for any communities.

              <p data-scroll>
                The effective implementation of SchistoGONE would be a lengthy
                and intensive process. With even more regulations to consider
                than in the previous sample area of Nigeria, adhering to all
                relevant African laws, extrapolating resources from out of one
                region and expanding into further regions (in terms of
                work-force wise, community acceptance) will take some time.
                After the preliminary support has been laid down for SchistoGONE
                and logistical issues are resolved, manual work will need to be
                carefully monitored along with the application of our project in
                order to gauge effectiveness and ensure uniformity.

              <h2 class="question" data-scroll>
                What if yeast gets into the water?
              </h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                One of the primary concerns regarding the practicality of the
                implementation of SchistoGONE is the potential impact to water
                quality and the environment in a situation where our yeast is
                erroneously released. The high prevalence of schistosomiasis in
                water-scarce regions and in populations dependent on natural
                bodies of water for most, if not all, of their water supply
                exacerbates the potential concerns that released yeast may have
                in water. For instance, South Africa, a country affected by
                schistosomiasis, is currently facing a water shortage crisis and
                as a result, authorities could be hesitant to put remaining
                water sources under potential risk of harm, which may include
                yeast. Furthermore, as detailed comprehensively in our
                environmental analysis, rich biodiversity is centered in water
                habitats within schistosomiasis-afflicted regions, and an
                uncontrolled release of yeast could result in ecosystem
                disruption.
                <br />
                <br />
                The nature of our project, however, addresses these concerns.
                SchistoGONE intends on utilizing genetically modified
                S.Cerevisiae yeast to synthesize antiparasitic products within
                isolated plates docked on the shore. The plates will contain a
                bioreactor and the necessary medium in order to carry out this
                function. In a situation where yeast is released into the water,
                it will be relatively benign. This is because without nutrients
                provided by the medium held in the plates and S.Cerevisiae's
                inability to compete for resources with other microorganisms, it
                will quickly use up its surplus resources, enhanced by the usage
                of energy in producing naturally inessential antiparasitic
                products, and die out. The excess production and release of
                antiparasitic products will not be of much concern either, as
                the yeast requires a substrate to bind in order to synthesize
                these products which are not available outside of the plates.
                <br /><br />

              <p data-scroll>
                In most cases, the yeast will not be harmful to snails. When
                released from the bioreactor, we have ensured that the yeast
                stays relatively benign, as it doesn't have the proper nutrients
                to sustain its lifestyle. While it might survive for a short
                period of time, other microorganisms will outcompete it, leading
                to no long-term impact on snails.

              <p data-scroll>
                The Nigerian federal government is split into many distinct
                civil service departments, collectively known as the Federal
                Ministries of Nigeria. There are two ministries that are
                relevant to our schistosomiasis project: the Federal Ministry of
                Water Resources and the Federal Ministry of Public Health.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Federal Ministry of Water Resources is responsible for
                developing and implementing policies to provide all Nigerians
                with safe access to water. One such policy is the National Water
                Resources Policy, which outlines the regulatory framework to
                achieve the goals of the state. As stated under the policy,
                water is a basic human right and an asset of the state, so
                private ownership of water is not allowed. Since our plan
                targets publicly owned waterways, we would need to seek approval
                from the ministry to implement our project. The ministry is
                heavily underfunded, so cooperation with private partners and
                donations are vital to the success of the program. In the past,
                there have also been issues in maintaining proper surveying and
                monitoring post-implementation, so additional personnel and
                resources would need to be provided.
                <br /><br />
                Specifically, in accordance with the Policy Statement 8 (Water
                Supply and Sanitation), the ministry is responsible for
                providing sufficient and adequate sanitation to enhance health.
                This includes initiatives to promote technology within the
                sanitation sector and prevent water-borne illnesses. Since our
                project attempts to use technology to clean water and remove
                parasitic worms that can spread schistosomiasis to humans, some
                of those initiatives would be likely to help us.

                Established in 1997 under the Federal Ministry of Transport, the
                National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) was named the primary
                authority for the regulation and development of inland navigable
                waterways in Nigeria. NIWA is the main governmental authority
                able to regulate waterways throughout the nation, with
                responsibilities spanning from infrastructure development to
                navigation to environmental surveying. Even with state
                governments attempting to gain control over their own waterways,
                such as the Lagos State Waterways Authority, NIWA was still
                legally declared by the Federal High Court as the competent
                authority. Well, that was up until 2017.
                <br />
                <br />
                After an appeal by the Lagos State authorities in July of 2017,
                the dispute over control of Nigerian waterways became much more
                convoluted. Both the state government and NIWA claim to have won
                the authority to control the navigable waterways in Lagos, with
                representatives on both sides publicly announcing to the media
                their opinion. It is generally accepted that all interstate
                waterways, those that run between two or more states, are under
                federal jurisdiction. This includes most of the largest bodies
                of water in Nigeria&mdash;such as the River Niger, the River
                Benue, and Lake Chad&mdash;which supply water to the majority of
                Nigerians. All intrastate and inland waterways, those that start
                and end entirely within one state, not mentioned under the NIWA
                are under state jurisdiction, though there is little clarity
                over the definition of "other intrastate waterways." The hazy
                line between state and federal authority in Nigeria complicates
                the process of seeking approval for projects involving waterways
                across the nation.
                <br /><br />
                In order for our project to be legally approved and granted a
                permit to implement SchistoGONE, we would likely need to go
                through the NIWA Research, Planning, and Environment (RPE)
                Department, which is responsible for Health, Safety, and
                Environment. While schistosomiasis is not explicitly listed
                among their responsibilities, the RPE handles all policy issues,
                budget preparations, and project monitoring about the
                surrounding environment of waterways. To attain public approval,
                we would need to conduct an extensive impact assessment to
                identify the main environmental implications of our project and
                how we can best create a low-risk, low-reliability plan. The
                funding for the project would have to come entirely from Public
                Private partnerships (PPP), as previous efforts by the Nigerian
                federal government to curb schistosomiasis were unsuccessful and
                these programs are generally underfunded.

              <h2 class="question" data-scroll>
                How would we lawfully implement our project? What steps would we
                have to take?
              </h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                Before implementation, we would have to confirm that the
                country's laws align with our project and that we have all
                necessary approval. Unfortunately, in many parts of Africa,
                where schistosomiasis is most common, there are no laws that
                address the use of synthetic biology. Because it could
                potentially be harmful to the environment and its people, most
                developing countries are reluctant about risky new technology.
                However, synthetic biology and biosafety conferences are being
                held and we are optimistic that countries will take this step in
                implementing synthetic biology.
                <br />
                <br />
                Because there are only synthetic biology laws in Nigeria, South
                Africa, and Kenya, we will be mainly focusing on laws in these
                countries, in hopes that other African countries will have
                similar synbio laws in the future.
                <br /><br />
                In Nigeria, we would have to get our project approved by the
                National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA), established in 2015
                by the Nigeria Biosafety Bill. Their core belief is that
                synthetic biology may help solve poverty issues, and have
                already implemented agricultural biotechnology to improve food
                security. The new regulations state that any project involving
                gene drive, gene editing, and synthetic biology must gain
                approval from the Agency to best minimize adverse effects. After
                submitting an application to the Agency, an internal review must
                be conducted with the possibility of additional information
                requests. Within 21 days, the project can be approved,
                indicating a relatively quick time frame from application to
                implementation. Since our final product contains recombinant
                DNA, it must also undergo a GMO regulation process.

                How long would the potential approval process take?
              </h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                As discussed throughout our review of schistosomiasis policy,
                many countries in which schistosomiasis is prevalent have
                agencies responsible for public health and water management with
                specific regulations and rules regarding project approval.
                However, durations for this vary due to numerous political and
                social considerations that we could potentially encounter in
                countries of interest.
                <br />
                <br />
                One of the primary hindrances to the approval of SchistoGONE in
                many countries studied is the lack of state funding and
                investment into schistosomiasis related causes, or an
                unwillingness to financially support initiatives with potential
                economic and environmental consequences if unsuccessful. For
                instance, Nigeria has been condemned by public health academics
                both within and internationally due to their relative inaction,
                exacerbated by the emergence of COVID-19. Despite commitments to
                the London Declaration and many WHO initiatives throughout the
                last 20 years, Nigeria has observed little to no changes in
                their schistosomiasis mortality rate. As discussed by Professor
                Oyeyemi at the University of Medical Science in Ondo State, the
                Nigerian government is only willing to invest in low-risk,
                low-liability plans with minimal economic commitment, which
                contrasts with the nature of our project. As a result, a
                meticulous process involving a solidified proof of concept and
                environmental analysis would be required in order to meet this
                criteria, which would require many years to conduct. However,
                other schistosomiasis-afflicted countries have demonstrated
                promising actions in order to tackle the disease. For instance,
                Kenya has implemented a deworming initiative which provide
                children with free deworming treatments. However, like Nigeria,
                Kenya and many other nations face other limiting factors.
