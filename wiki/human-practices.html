                Schistosomiasis is a devastating neglected tropical disease (NTD) that affects over 240,000,000 people globally and results in 200,000
                deaths annually. Despite these shocking statistics, the parasitic disease is currently widely unaddressed in many impoverished
                third-world countries where it is most concentrated. Millions of families around the world continue to live at high risk of infection
                because of poor water sanitation and limited health care availability.
                <br /><br />
                The standard method to treat schistosomiasis is the antischistosomal drug praziquantel, which while effective in treating infection
                temporarily, is unable to provide long-term immunity or prevent reinfection. There are also many socioeconomic barriers present that
                prevent widespread access to such medicines, leaving infected patients untreated and at risk of severe organ failure or even eventual
                death.
                <br /><br />
                For these reasons, our team, CCA_San_Diego, decided to focus our efforts on minimizing schistosomiasis cases through the natural
                synthesis and controlled release of sanguinarine&mdash;an antischistosomal drug&mdash;into environments where schistosomes are
                prevalent. While this solution may be effective in eradicating parasites out of snail populations, the potential for the release of
                genetically modified yeast comes with many environmental and ethical concerns. Thus, throughout our project, our team centered our
                human practices approach around the conversations with our community, as well as in-depth discussions with schistosomiasis experts
                about the greater implications of our solution.

              <h2 data-scroll>Introduction</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                The issue of schistosomiasis does not directly affect the region where our team is based, so we wanted to design an approach to Human
                Practices that would best incorporate the values of the general public and expert opinions to design a good solution. We knew it would
                be difficult to travel to heavily affected areas or gain connections with people infected by schistosomiasis, so we depended greatly
                on broader opinions about the ethics and safety of our solution. Throughout each stage of our project, we engaged in many
                conversations to best align our project with our main priorities.
                <br /><br />
                Our project used "The Three Triangles Process" (diagram located below), which we chose for the simultaneous convergence of the
                Discovery and Ideation stages to the initial solution we developed. Through our discussions with schistosomiasis experts, we gained
                not only a deeper understanding of the problem of schistosomiasis, but also received advice on how to proceed with our project design.
                This dual action enabled us to constantly refine our solution through a consideration of the broader environmental or ethical impacts
                and the technical aspects.

            <div class="container-text">
              <h2 data-scroll>Three Main Stages</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                <span class="highlight">Discovery</span> This stage was focused on gaining a deeper understanding of schistosomiasis as a disease, as
                well as the societal issues and health problems that are currently posed by schistosomiasis. We initially selected schistosomiasis as
                our target disease because of its widespread impact on human livelihood globally but lack of concrete solutions to tackle the issue.
                To gauge the public perception of NTDs, and specifically schistosomiasis, we conducted a Human Practices survey that asked respondents
                to rate their awareness of schistosomiasis and the necessity for a novel solution. Our team also reached out to many schistosomiasis
                experts, such as researchers and physicians, to understand snail-parasite interactions and the onset of disease in infected humans.
                <br /><br />
                <span class="highlight">Ideation</span> Simultaneous to "Discovery" was the process of developing our initial solution. Our lab team
                underwent a thorough process of literature reviews to understand current approaches to the schistosomiasis problem, as well as
                potential avenues for our synthetic biology solution. After settling on the production of a natural compound to directly kill
                schistosomes, we received input from many professors and researchers about the feasibility of the prototype and the selected compound,
                which at the time was still plumbagin. We constantly revised our solution to be scientifically sound and feasible. <br /><br />
                <span class="highlight">Delivery</span> After the development of our solution, we began to research how we could implement our
                bioreactor containing the genetically modified yeast across high-risk areas in an environmentally safe and ethical manner. In order to
                understand the main concerns of our community about the implementation of our device, we returned to our Human Practices survey to
                analyze the comfortability of respondents regarding use of genetically modified yeast to treat contaminated water. Our team also
                conducted a policy review of current African state laws that could affect the implementation of our device, such as synthetic biology
                regulations and authorities over nationally-owned waterways.

              <h2 data-scroll>Three Main Milestones</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                <span class="highlight">The Brief</span> At the beginning of our iGEM journey, our team brainstormed potential project ideas and were
                immediately intrigued by antiparasitic compounds produced through genetically modified organisms. While there are many parasitic
                diseases prevalent today, our team narrowed down on schistosomiasis because it is the second most dangerous disease and found in many
                underdeveloped nations. With our initial idea in mind, we began to research specific natural products with antiparasitic properties
                and the method of drug delivery. <br /><br />
                <span class="highlight">The Concept</span> The convergent thinking of "Discovery" and "Ideation" led to the development of our most
                promising solution to treat schistosomiasis&mdash;genetically engineering yeast to produce sanguinarine to kill schistosomes in
                infected snails. <br /><br />
                <span class="highlight">The Product</span> We developed a cohesive design and approach for implementation. First, we designed a CAD
                model and physical 3D-printed prototype of our bioreactor that would produce yeast for plates on the shores of infected waters.

            <div class="container-text">
              <h2 data-scroll>Environmental Safety</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                Schistosomiasis is a waterborne parasitic disease that is often found in tropical areas due to its intermediary host&mdash;the
                freshwater snail. This means that our yeast bioreactor must be located on the shores of freshwater bodies of water to ensure snails
                uptake the yeast, and consequently, the antiparasitic sanguinarine compound. While this may treat snails of infection and prevent
                transmission to humans, it also comes with a myriad of environmental issues that must be taken into consideration for safe
                implementation of our solution.
                <br />
                <br />
                Despite studies showing that genetically modified yeast do not have increased survivability rates compared to wild-type yeast, it
                would be irresponsible to release our engineered yeast without any regulations or monitoring, especially considering the controversy
                that still surrounds synthetic biology in the environment. We needed to ensure our compound was not fatal for the freshwater snails or
                other native species, which are important ecologically in the aquatic ecosystem.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="container-text">
              <h2 data-scroll>Ethical Responsibility</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                Synthetic biology is a novel field with lots of potential in producing solutions for modern problems, but with these advancements come
                many ethical concerns. We knew that synthetic biology was necessary to achieve the goals of our project and reduce schistosomiasis
                presence in the environment, so our team used a human-centric approach to engage in conversations with experts and the community.
                <br />
                <br />
                As we saw through our Human Practices survey, 34.5% of respondents still believe that synthetic biology is not an ethical or safe
                practice. To ensure we align with these ethical goals, we conducted an extensive selection process for our natural compound to select
                sanguinarine, as well as an environmental analysis of our solution. Before finalizing the method of delivering our antischistosomal
                drug, we consulted many synthetic biology professors and schistosomiasis experts to understand the ethics of our solution. We
                underwent a constant cycle of research and development to ensure that our final solution, delivering sanguinarine on land via yeast,
                was the most ethical approach.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="container-text">
              <h2 data-scroll>Scientific Feasibility</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                We have aspirations for our projects to solve root causes of schistosomiasis, but we also had to be realistic in how much our project
                could achieve without compromising the health of freshwater ecosystems. We knew that if our project was very far-fetched and
                unfeasible, implementing it would be very dangerous and could potentially fail. Therefore, we made sure to work with our lab team to
                find an acceptable balance between potential problems of SchistoGONE and how much we could help the current situation of
                schistosomiasis.
                <br />
                <br />
                For instance, one concern brought up to us through our HP survey was that the parasites would eventually develop resistance to
                sanguinarine. However, we decided that this problem of resistance applies to all drug discovery, and that its advancement should not
                be hindered altogether. We did research appropriate doses to give to the schistosomes to ensure they are killed without being toxic to
                its hosts.

              <h2 data-scroll>Overview</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                Our team used a digital survey to gather information about the main values, priorities, and concerns of the public. The survey asked
                questions covering the safety and ethics of synthetic biology more broadly, as well as its application in tackling neglected tropical
                diseases. We received a total of 336 responses, which came from a diverse pool of respondents. The data we collected was essential in
                designing a responsible, ethical, and safe solution that aligns with the perspectives of the public.
                <br />
                <br />
                From this survey, we found out that many people in our community were unfamiliar with NTDs, the basis of our project. Because of this
                information, we made our Schistosomiasis PSA website to educate more people about a disease that we think needs immediate attention
                and solutions.
                <br />
                <br />
                <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4261/wiki/2022-10-09-00-54-58-igem-hp-survey-xlsx-excel.png" alt="" />
                <br />
                <br />
                We also found that our community believes that we have a very strong ethical obligation to inform our consumers that our device
                contains modified organisms. Although most people also responded that they would be comfortable using our product, quite a few people
                were also skeptical about it, expressing that they were worried about our compounds or yeast escaping into the environment.
                <br /><br />
                <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4261/wiki/2022-10-09-01-12-13-igem-hp-survey-xlsx-excel.png" alt="" />
                <br />
                <br />
                We heard these considerations from our respondents, and because so many people were concerned about the disruption of ecosystems from
                releasing the compound directly and what would become of dead worms in the water, we changed our project's design. After the survey
                analysis, we were motivated to switch to the snails consuming the yeast directly instead of releasing plumbagin (the compound we were
                considering then), into infected waters.

                On October 3rd, as a collaboration, our iGEM team, DNHS, and WVHS held an ethics symposium at the J. Craig Venter Institute. Because
                we saw that many people in our respective Human Practices surveys did not know much about synthetic biology ethics, we wanted to
                educate the San Diego community of how ethical practices are maintained in research. We had an impressive lineup of iGEM members,
                student researchers, and professional researchers give presentations about ethical issues in research today, and what ethical values

                  <span class="highlight">Takeaways</span> We gained crucial insight on the importance of environmental safety in both the choice of
                  anti-schistosomal compound and implementation of the project. Ultimately, his guidance steered our project in the direction that
                  SchistoGONE currently is in. <br /><br />
                  <span class="highlight">Moving Forward</span> Dr. Caffrey allowed us his expertise in Schistosoma Mansoni and his continued guidance
                  through much of the season, which has been integral to our project in terms of environmental safety, antischistosomal effectiveness,
                  and implementation. We are extremely grateful to him and his work at the CDIPD as the CCA team was able to receive data on our
                  antischistosomal compounds tested on live schistosoma sporocysts.

                    >To get a better understanding of plumbagin, we met with professor Joshua Widhalm from Purdue University. Dr. Widhalm provided
                    solutions on how to utilize plumbagin without toxicity as an environmental issue.
                  </span>
                  <br /><br />
                  <span class="highlight">Takeaways</span> We learned that internal concentration of plumbagin is not the same as the external
                  concentration and that the toxicity level varies. He also informed us that plumbagin can break down in sunlight, so it wouldn't be a
                  major issue. In order to prevent autotoxicity, we needed to transport the plumbagin during synthesis. <br /><br />
                  <span class="highlight">Moving Forward</span> Professor Widhalm encouraged us to look closer into plumbagin and methods to prevent
                  toxicity in ecosystems. Although we ended up changing plumbagin to sanguinarine a few months later, Dr. Widhalm's knowledge taught
                  us how to explore methods of making a compound lethal to schistosomes, but not other organisms in the water. <br /><br />

                  <span class="highlight">Takeaways</span> Reed gave us insight into schistosomiasis as a disease and how it has been treated in the
                  past. For example, we learned that many efforts to treat schistosomiasis in the military have been made, one being a topical

                  <br /><br />
                  <span class="highlight">Takeaways</span> We learned that worms use a chemical gradient to find snails to infect and in which part of
                  the worm's life cycle we should try to kill it. Initially, we were planning on trying to find a way to kill the cercariae form of
                  the worm (when its mature and looking for a human to infect), but he advised us to kill the worm in its miracidia (when the worm is
                  swimming and finding a snail) or the sporocyst (inside the snail) phase. He also helped us gain access to research that we did not
                  have access to.<br /><br />
                  <span class="highlight">Moving Forward</span> Using the research and advice that Dr. Zhang provided us, we decided to target the
                  miracidia and sporocyst phases of the worm's life. This really helped us narrow down where we would target the parasite, inside the
                  snail, by focusing on only a few life cycles. <br /><br />

                  water could pick up plasmids and be lethal, so we may want to look into modifying the snails themselves. She also encouraged us to
                  reach out to communities and governments in Africa and areas where we want to implement SchistoGONE in the future. <br /><br />

                    >Dr. Karin Fester works at the University of Leipzig in the Institute of Pharmacy. As a phytochemist, she published a paper on an
                    attempt to produce plumbagin in e. coli; however, it did not work initially because they did not have the full biosynthetic
                    pathway down due to missing enzymes. One of our team members encountered Dr. Fester's paper and found it very relevant and
                    insightful to our current project, so we contacted her to see if she would meet with us.
                  </span>
                  <br /><br />
                  <span class="highlight">Takeaways</span> From Dr. Fester, we realized that instead of trying to produce plumbagin in e. coli, which
                  is difficult due to missing enzymes for the biosynthetic pathway, we should use yeast because it has an endoplasmic reticulum and is
                  a eukaryotic expression system. Eventually, we decided to use saccharomyces cerevisiae, a species of yeast that has already been
                  used for much research and showed success. Dr. Fester's advice was also key in our switch away from plumbagin as our compound. She
                  recommended pimaradenoic acid, which is easier to produce. <br /><br />
                  <span class="highlight">Moving Forward</span> From our meeting with Dr. Fester, we changed many aspects of our project. We switched
                  away from both e. Coli and plumbagin, and although we had to conduct a lot more literature review and research for this change, it
                  ultimately made our project more feasible. <br /><br />

                  <br /><br />
                  <span class="highlight">Takeaways</span> From Dr. Le Clec'h, we realized that releasing a compound to feed the snails under lab
                  conditions was possible, but in a realistic setting, would be much more difficult because the plasmids could be easily incorporated.
                  She advised the usage of yeast, as pheromones can attract the snails and that they should be consuming some kind of compound. The
                  most important thing she taught us about was the immune response of the snail once it is invaded by the schistosome. If the snail
                  and schistosome are compatible, the snail will fail to have a successful immune defense. However, if they are incompatible, the
                  snail will be able to kill off the worm.<br /><br />
                  <span class="highlight">Moving Forward</span> Dr. Le Clec'h was very important in our project design because she got us thinking
                  about the snails' immune responses to the parasite. We got the idea of possibly exploiting the snail's immune response to kill off
                  the parasites immediately upon their entrance.<br /><br />

                    Professor Larissa Podust conducts pharmaceutical research at UCSD. As a structural biologist, we were interested in her research
                    of drugs targeting parasitic diseases. At the time, we didn't have much information on how the compound itself would work, and had
                    mainly focused on its production.

                  <br /><br />
                  <span class="highlight">Takeaways</span> We focused on the specificity of drug delivery: how would we deliver our compound in the
                  most effective manner? Dr. Podust encouraged us to think about how to maximize the specificity of our drug to ensure that the
                  parasites, our target, would be able to come in contact with sanguinarine and die. We also learned a bit about drug kinetics: how
                  quickly would the drug work and degrade? We realized that the compound would not be effective if it degraded before reaching
                  schistosomes. <br /><br />
                  <span class="highlight">Moving Forward</span> We crossed off releasing it through a water-based delivery mechanism on our list, and
                  instead started narrowing down the targeting phases or attracting snails. We ended up combining the two ideas, attracting the snails
                  into eating the substance which then targets sporocysts in the cells. <br /><br />
