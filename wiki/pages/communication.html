          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Over the summer, our team hosted a STEM summer camp that encompassed
            biology, chemistry, synthetic biology, and forensics. We held two
            one-week sessions, and a total of 25 students attended. We wanted to
            hold our camp at the lab classrooms of our school so that students
            would have a more hands-on experience and learn more. Most of our
            students were in middle school, or between the ages of 11-14.

          <h2>Curriculum</h2>
          <p>
            We designed all of our curriculum for our camp, based around four
            subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Synthetic Biology, and Forensics.
            Since our main demographic was middle schoolers interested in
            science, we aimed for a 9th-10th grade level of difficulty,
            especially in biology and chemistry. We wanted to cover biology and
            chemistry in the first two days because it would be essential for
            understanding synthetic biology and forensics, two subjects that
            aren't taught in school. <br /><br />
            Every day, we had several slide decks covering crucial topics for
            each subject. For instance, in chemistry, we'd have a separate
            lecture for the periodic table, matter, chemical reactions, and
            density. We also incorporated a few labs in between each lecture to
            reinforce the topics. Our slides were engaging and fun, with videos
            and simulations so that the students wouldn't get bored. We also had
            a participation point system with quiz questions for each slide
            deck, and the student with the most points received a gift card at
            the end of the week.

          <h2>Labs</h2>
          <p>
            We organized two to three labs each day. They reinforced what
            students learned during the lectures so that they could understand
            and visualize it better. We had a few simple labs such as strawberry
            DNA extraction and leaf chad photosynthesis, but we had quite a few
            complex labs as well. For example, for the synthetic biology
            portion, the students performed a bacterial transformation, putting
            GFP genes into e. Coli. Another advanced lab that we did measured
            how different factors, such as surface area, concentration, and
            temperatures, can affect the rate of chemical reactions.
            <br /><br />
            We made sure students were adequately prepared for each lab. We did
            a presentation about lab safety and etiquette, and proper
            consequences were reinforced for those who did not follow the safety
            procedures. Most of our students were pretty mature, so it wasn't a
            problem throughout both sessions.

          <h2>Survey Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            We had the students take a survey both before and after the camp in
            order to gauge how much they learned and benefitted from our camp.
            We had quiz questions about each of the topics taught, and the
            students tested their knowledge on the topics on the first and last
            day. Additionally, at the end, the students evaluated factors such
            as how much they paid attention and how much they thought they
            learned. <br /><br />
            Overall, students generally answered 7.5/10 on how much they felt
            they learned, and a 7.36/10 on how much they paid attention. The
            high scores for engagement reflect the increase in average quiz
            score. The "after" quiz score was 1.23 points higher than the
            "before" quiz score, with the total being out of 9.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            We created a 41-page book, <em>Introduction to Bacteria</em>, in
            order to provide a resource for understanding a critical domain of
            organisms. This included coverage on bacteria anatomy,
            classification, identification, functions, and applicability in
            synthetic biology and scientific study: our book's content is
            aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), ensuring
            its modernity and applicability in an educational environment. The
            book was created with the objective of providing a collective of
            relevant, well-rounded information for advanced middle school to
            college students to utilize. We intend on publishing our book
            through Amazon KDP, offering our book free of charge in order to
            achieve our objectives for the book's outreach to everyone. .

          <h2>Translations &amp; Audiobook</h2>
          <p>
            In order to extend our book's reach to a larger audience, we created
            translations of our book in Chinese, French, Korean, and Spanish.
            This enhances the accessibility of our book, especially to countries
            where access to STEM education may be limited by linguistic
            barriers. In an effort to ensure accessibility is considered in as
            many areas as possible, we also recorded an audio version of our
            book for auditory learners and individuals with certain impediments.
