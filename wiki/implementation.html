                Although we are confident that our project, SchistoGONE, will positively impact many
                communities with the absence of disease, we must follow ethical practices in
                implementing our project globally. Through a discussion on implementation, our team
                tackles how exactly we would install bioreactors and plates, safety issues that may
                arise, and even the local laws that would help or hurt us in reaching our goal.

                Because our project targets a common disease directly instead of manufacturing a
                product for a market, there is no specific group of people that our yeast product
                would go to. Instead, our project would be widely implemented into public rivers and
                waterways where citizens bathe and gather water from, ultimately benefiting all
                people who could potentially contract Schistosomiasis. Communities that lack
                sufficient funding on medical care would no longer place concern and resources on
                infections that are prevented, and citizens more vulnerable to the parasitic
                effects, like school children and the elderly, may join more recreational and
                physical activities involving rivers and lakes.

              <h2 data-scroll>Introduction</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                Implementation of Schistogone will require several steps, including thorough
                consideration of the laws in the country we will apply it to. Unfortunately, in
                Africa, where schistosomiasis is most prevalent, there aren't any laws regarding
                synthetic biology safety. The field is still becoming accepted globally and many
                countries are not prepared to take on financial risks. However, Nigeria, South
                Africa, and Kenya do have laws in place, so we will be studying their laws in hopes
                that other countries will soon follow suit.
                <br />
                <br />
                Firstly, there are policies and laws that would assist the implementation of
                Schistogone like the National Water Resources Policy, which outlines the regulatory
                framework to achieve the goals of the state and Policy Statement 8 (Water Supply and
                Sanitation). It includes initiatives to promote technology within the sanitation
                sector and prevent water-borne illnesses. However, complex disputes regarding
                waterways in Nigeria&mdash;one of our target countries&mdash;in 2017 between
                National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) and the state government may produce
                possible obstacles in implementing Schistogone in Nigeria. We would need to `go
                through the NIWA Research, Planning, and Environment (RPE) Department, which is
                responsible for Health, Safety, and Environment, and also conduct an extensive
                impact assessment to identify the main environmental implications of our project and
                how we can best create a low-risk, low-reliability plan for public approval.
                <br /><br />
                Most extensive information about synthetic biology laws in Nigeria, South Africa,
                and Kenya is in our policy review.

              <p data-scroll>
                In order to prevent schistosomiasis, we will be genetically engineering W303
                Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. The yeast will be placed on the shores of
                schistosomiasis-infected waters, attracting snails so that they will consume the
                yeast. Our modified W303 Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast will produce sanguinarine
                inside its cell walls, which will be released after snails consume the yeast and
                enzymes inside the snail's stomach have broken through the cell membranes and walls.
                The sanguinarine will kill the worms inside the snails, removing the disease once it
                enters the snail's bloodstream.

              <p data-scroll>
                We built a bioreactor to culture our yeast cells, and it will pump the yeast to
                plates on the shores of infected rivers. Snails will be attracted to the scent of
                the yeast and come up to the plates themselves. This way, we do not have to pour our
                compound into the rivers and risk disrupting other ecosystems and forms of life.

              <p data-scroll>
                Since our project would greatly impact the communities Schistogone is implemented
                into, communicating with the people whose water source will be affected would be a
                top priority. The public will be informed thoroughly about all aspects of the
                project, including the scientific reasoning behind the components of Schistogone and
                any possible side effects of using or consuming the affected water. Education on
                this subject would hopefully create a relationship of trust between our team and the
                community, allowing for a constant stream of feedback and responses. Before
                implementation, we want to answer any questions citizens have and resolve any of
                their concerns so that SchistoGONE can benefit as many people as possible without
                becoming a source of grievance for any communities.

              <p data-scroll>
                The effective implementation of SchistoGONE would be a lengthy and intensive
                process. With even more regulations to consider than in the previous sample area of
                Nigeria, adhering to all relevant African laws, extrapolating resources from out of
                one region and expanding into further regions (in terms of work-force wise,
                community acceptance) will take some time. After the preliminary support has been
                laid down for SchistoGONE and logistical issues are resolved, manual work will need
                to be carefully monitored along with the application of our project in order to
                gauge effectiveness and ensure uniformity.

              <h2 class="question" data-scroll>What if yeast gets into the water?</h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                One of the primary concerns regarding the practicality of the implementation of
                schistoGONE is the potential impact to water quality and the environment in a
                situation where our yeast is erroneously released. The high prevalence of
                schistosomiasis in water-scarce regions and in populations dependent on natural
                bodies of water for most, if not all, of their water supply exacerbates the
                potential concerns that released yeast may have in water. For instance, South
                Africa, a country affected by schistosomiasis, is currently facing a water shortage
                crisis and as a result, authorities could be hesitant to put remaining water sources
                under potential risk of harm, which may include yeast. Furthermore, as detailed
                comprehensively in our environmental analysis, rich biodiversity is centered in
                water habitats within schistosomiasis-afflicted regions, and an uncontrolled release
                of yeast could result in ecosystem disruption.
                <br />
                <br />
                The nature of our project, however, addresses these concerns. SchistoGONE intends on
                utilizing genetically modified S.Cerevisiae yeast to synthesize antiparasitic
                products within isolated plates docked on the shore. The plates will contain a
                bioreactor and the necessary medium in order to carry out this function. In a
                situation where yeast is released into the water, it will be relatively benign. This
                is because without nutrients provided by the medium held in the plates and
                S.Cerevisiae's inability to compete for resources with other microorganisms, it will
                quickly use up its surplus resources, enhanced by the usage of energy in producing
                naturally inessential antiparasitic products, and die out. The excess production and
                release of antiparasitic products will not be of much concern either, as the yeast
                requires a substrate to bind in order to synthesize these products which are not
                available outside of the plates.
                <br /><br />

              <p data-scroll>
                In most cases, the yeast will not be harmful to snails. When released from the
                bioreactor, we have ensured that the yeast stays relatively benign, as it doesn't
                have the proper nutrients to sustain its lifestyle. While it might survive for a
                short period of time, other microorganisms will outcompete it, leading to no
                long-term impact on snails.

                What local laws would help us in implementing our project?
              </h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                The Nigerian federal government is split into many distinct civil service
                departments, collectively known as the Federal Ministries of Nigeria. There are two
                ministries that are relevant to our schistosomiasis project: the Federal Ministry of
                Water Resources and the Federal Ministry of Public Health.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Federal Ministry of Water Resources is responsible for developing and
                implementing policies to provide all Nigerians with safe access to water. One such
                policy is the National Water Resources Policy, which outlines the regulatory
                framework to achieve the goals of the state. As stated under the policy, water is a
                basic human right and an asset of the state, so private ownership of water is not
                allowed. Since our plan targets publicly owned waterways, we would need to seek
                approval from the ministry to implement our project. The ministry is heavily
                underfunded, so cooperation with private partners and donations are vital to the
                success of the program. In the past, there have also been issues in maintaining
                proper surveying and monitoring post-implementation, so additional personnel and
                resources would need to be provided.
                <br /><br />
                Specifically, in accordance with the Policy Statement 8 (Water Supply and
                Sanitation), the ministry is responsible for providing sufficient and adequate
                sanitation to enhance health. This includes initiatives to promote technology within
                the sanitation sector and prevent water-borne illnesses. Since our project attempts
                to use technology to clean water and remove parasitic worms that can spread
                schistosomiasis to humans, some of those initiatives would be likely to help us.

              <p data-scroll>
                Established in 1997 under the Federal Ministry of Transport, the National Inland
                Waterways Authority (NIWA) was named the primary authority for the regulation and
                development of inland navigable waterways in Nigeria. NIWA is the main governmental
                authority able to regulate waterways throughout the nation, with responsibilities
                spanning from infrastructure development to navigation to environmental surveying.
                Even with state governments attempting to gain control over their own waterways,
                such as the Lagos State Waterways Authority, NIWA was still legally declared by the
                Federal High Court as the competent authority. Well, that was up until 2017.
                <br />
                <br />
                After an appeal by the Lagos State authorities in July of 2017, the dispute over
                control of Nigerian waterways became much more convoluted. Both the state government
                and NIWA claim to have won the authority to control the navigable waterways in
                Lagos, with representatives on both sides publicly announcing to the media their
                opinion. It is generally accepted that all interstate waterways, those that run
                between two or more states, are under federal jurisdiction. This includes most of
                the largest bodies of water in Nigeria&mdash;such as the River Niger, the River
                Benue, and Lake Chad&mdash;which supply water to the majority of Nigerians. All
                intrastate and inland waterways, those that start and end entirely within one state,
                not mentioned under the NIWA are under state jurisdiction, though there is little
                clarity over the definition of “other intrastate waterways.” The hazy line between
                state and federal authority in Nigeria complicates the process of seeking approval
                for projects involving waterways across the nation.
                <br /><br />
                In order for our project to be legally approved and granted a permit to implement
                SchistoGONE, we would likely need to go through the NIWA Research, Planning, and
                Environment (RPE) Department, which is responsible for Health, Safety, and
                Environment. While schistosomiasis is not explicitly listed among their
                responsibilities, the RPE handles all policy issues, budget preparations, and
                project monitoring about the surrounding environment of waterways. To attain public
                approval, we would need to conduct an extensive impact assessment to identify the
                main environmental implications of our project and how we can best create a
                low-risk, low-reliability plan. The funding for the project would have to come
                entirely from Public Private partnerships (PPP), as previous efforts by the Nigerian
                federal government to curb schistosomiasis were unsuccessful and these programs are
                generally underfunded.

                How would we lawfully implement our project? What steps would we have to take?
              </h2>
              <p data-scroll>
                Before implementation, we would have to confirm that the country's laws align with
                our project and that we have all necessary approval. Unfortunately, in many parts of
                Africa, where schistosomiasis is most common, there are no laws that address the use
                of synthetic biology. Because it could potentially be harmful to the environment and
                its people, most developing countries are reluctant about risky new technology.
                However, synthetic biology and biosafety conferences are being held and we are
                optimistic that countries will take this step in implementing synthetic biology.
                <br />
                <br />
                Because there are only synthetic biology laws in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya,
                we will be mainly focusing on laws in these countries, in hopes that other African
                countries will have similar synbio laws in the future.
                <br /><br />
                In Nigeria, we would have to get our project approved by the National Biosafety
                Management Agency (NBMA), established in 2015 by the Nigeria Biosafety Bill. Their
                core belief is that synthetic biology may help solve poverty issues, and have
                already implemented agricultural biotechnology to improve food security. The new
                regulations state that any project involving gene drive, gene editing, and synthetic
                biology must gain approval from the Agency to best minimize adverse effects. After
                submitting an application to the Agency, an internal review must be conducted with
                the possibility of additional information requests. Within 21 days, the project can
                be approved, indicating a relatively quick time frame from application to
                implementation. Since our final product contains recombinant DNA, it must also
                undergo a GMO regulation process.
