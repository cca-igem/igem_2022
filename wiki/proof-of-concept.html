                One of the key components of our proposed implementation involves <em>Biomphalaria Glabrata</em> being attracted to the W303 yeast in
                order to deliver sanguinarine. Should the molluscs not even recognize the presence of our modified yeast microorganisms, the proposed
                implementation would fail. Thankfully, it is a well known trick in agriculture communities that yeast can be used to attract snails,
                and numerous studies confirm this innate attraction (Chan et al 14). However, a precedent has not been set for whether snails actually
                prefer yeast over other available food options in the environment. Should <em>Biomphalaria Glabrata</em> ignore our yeast plates in
                favor of more attractive options, the proposed implementation would fail again. <br /><br />
                As such, to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing SchistoGONE using eco-plates in the environment, we conducted tests on whether
                snails have a preference for yeast over other food sources. We conducted this experiment by presenting
                <em>Pomacea Bridgesii</em> snails with two options of lettuce: regular and W303 yeast-covered lettuce. By measuring the number of
                times the snails consume the yeast-covered lettuce, we were able to determine that the snails have an inherent preference for the
                presence of yeast. In the 20 trials of testing, 16 resulted in the snail selecting the yeast option. In a control test, we presented
                snails with two equal options of regular lettuce and randomly assigned one of the pieces to be the fake "yeast" option. The snails
                chose the "yeast" option by random chance, 11 out of 20 times. <br /><br />
                <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4261/wiki/lab-stuff/proofofconcept1.png" alt="" />
                <br /><br />
                In order to verify the significance of the snail preference for yeast, we ran 5000 simulations of our null hypothesis (that yeast has
                no attraction for snails), each consisting of 20 random decisions between yeast and non-yeast. <br /><br />
                <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4261/wiki/lab-stuff/proofofconcept2.png" alt="" />
                <br /><br />
                The sampling distribution for this proportion was then modeled using a normal curve. <br /><br />
                <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4261/wiki/lab-stuff/proofofconcept3.png" alt="" />
                <br /><br />
                By taking the expected proportion (p) as 0.5 from the 20 trials (n), the mean and standard deviation are 0.5 and 0.1118 respectively.
                <br /><br />
                <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4261/wiki/lab-stuff/proofofconcept4.png" alt="" />
                <br /><br />
                A z-score is then calculated, revealing our observed 0.8 proportion of yeast is in the 99th percentile should it be by random chance.
                Assuming the yeast we used in our experiment did not attract the snails in any capacity, there is a less than 1% chance of the
                observed preference for yeast lettuce occuring. The results are significant enough to reject the null hypothesis with a confidence
                level of 99%. As such, it can be concluded that there is a preference for W303 yeast for molluscs in our experiments.

                Another key component of our proposed implementation involves our modified sanguinarine-producing microorganisms surviving
                environmental conditions in target geographies. Previous literature has confirmed that E.coli and W303 yeast are capable of surviving
                in open environments thriving in natural bodies of water (Chekabab et al 13). However, in the event of rising tides or waves crashing
                into the plate, it is unknown if the modified W303 yeast will be able to survive specific conditions in target locations such as
                Africa. Should the W303 yeast perish after short exposure to the natural conditions of the environment, the proposed implementation
                would fail.
                <br /><br />As such, to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing SchistoGONE in target environments&mdash;primarily Africa&mdash;we
                designed a microcosm for testing the survival of yeast in conditions mimicking Lake Malawi, a notoriously schistosome infested water.
                We were able to replicate the pH, sedimentation, salinity, temperature, general hardness, and carbonate hardness following
                specifications from numerous sources of literature. Microcosms have long been used as artificial, simplified ecosystems and many
                studies have used this concept to test their own hypotheses on. Many of the alterations that were implemented were based off of a
                prior study where researchers mimicked rice paddy fields in Africa due to the locational similarities between their study and ours
                (Akpodiete et al 21). Our pH, sedimentation, salinity, temperature, general hardness, and carbonate hardness value replications were
                based on prior recorded data on Lake Malawi's characteristics in order to produce more accurate results (Massinga et al 22).
                <br /><br />
                Water was sampled before, immediately after, 24 hours after, and then 48 hours after insertion of W303 s. cerevisiae, and then placed
                in a yeast agar plate to observe potential growth due to surviving s. Cerevisiae.
                <br /><br />
                <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4261/wiki/lab-stuff/proofofconcept5.png" alt="" />
                <br /><br />There was no presence of yeast in the initial sampling. Immediately, 24 hours, and 48 hours after yeast was inserted into
                the water, the samples returned notable W303 colony growth. This confirmed that yeast had survived in the simulated conditions.
                Because the W303 yeast was still alive in the microcosm waters, we rationalized that SchistoGONE eco-plates would remain functional in
                rising and turbulent tides.

                One of the most important aspects of our proposed implementation is sanguinarine killing schistosoma sporocysts. Though sanguinarine
                has been confirmed as a cercaricidal against schistosoma in existing literature, sanguinarine testing on schistosoma sporocysts is
                unprecedented (Zhang et al 13). As such, in order to confirm that the use of sanguinarine in <em>B. Glabrata</em> snails would be able
                to eliminate the residing sporocyst phase of schistosoma, we aspired to conduct an assay on the survival of schistosoma sporocysts
                given concentrations of sanguinarine, as well as other anti-schistosomal compounds plumbagin and continentalic acid.
                <br /><br />Graciously, Dr. Connor Caffrey from the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (CDIPD) offered to
                conduct the assays for our team's project as the CDIPD has an established history of working with and possessing the schistosoma
                parasite. Dr. Caffrey designed the procedures and generated replicative data on the three anti-schistosomal compounds. From his study,
                he determined that sanguinarine was the most potent compared to the other two compounds tested. The number proportion of alive
                sporocysts were analyzed for different concentrations of each compound. Sanguinarine had a recorded 50% effective concentration of
                ~0.25 &micro;M, followed by plumbagin (EC50 ~5 &micro;M), whereas continentalic acid was ineffective even at the highest concentration
                of 5 &micro;M. <br /><br />
